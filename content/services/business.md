For businesses, I focus on designing and implementing reliable technology solutions. This includes setting up networks for new buildings, upgrading outdated infrastructure, configuring firewalls and security systems, managing cloud services, and providing both remote and onsite technical support. Whether itâ€™s troubleshooting day-to-day issues or engineering large-scale projects, my goal is to ensure your technology works smoothly and supports your business effectively.
