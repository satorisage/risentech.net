Hey! I’m Stephen. I’ve been into technology since I was programming my mom’s VCR at around 2 years old. I offer both residential and business tech services, and you can check out the certifications I’ve earned over the years below. If you’re interested in my services, head over to my contact page for details on how to reach me.
